Just go and get [**Ferro**](http://www.getferro.com/), a google chrome extension, that enables shortcuts for google chrome.

By which, by default, you now can toggle pin tab in Google Chrome using `alt+shift+p`. Of course, you can customize it !

Actually, **Ferro** has so much more to offer ... wish you have a good time with it :D
