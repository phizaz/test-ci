You probably have this app pre-installed so search for it first.
If not, in any case, install it via `apt install shutter`.

Now, we will start using it.

Open the app **Shutter**, and go right to the preferences pane.

On the first page you might want to select **automatically save file** and **automatically copy screenshot to clipboard** like this:

And to keep the shutter programe from opening after we capture the screenshot you might want to uncheck the **present main window after taking a screenshot** option like this:

![](/content/images/2017/02/002_Shutter---Preferences-1.png)

Now, the only part left is to bind it with shortcuts, we'll go to the **keyboard** settings, if you can't remember it's this one:

Go to the **shortcuts** menu, and create some:

![](/content/images/2017/02/004_Keyboard.png)

Each of which is described as follows:

![](/content/images/2017/02/Custom-Shortcut_009.png)

![](/content/images/2017/02/Custom-Shortcut_008.png)

![](/content/images/2017/02/Custom-Shortcut_007.png)

Note that these are the **shutter** options you can see full list from `shutter --help`
