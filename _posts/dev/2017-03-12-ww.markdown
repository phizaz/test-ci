Using `dconf-editor`, if you have already tried the `xmodmap` way, tried this one ... it's superior because the **xmodmap** will fail (and need to be rerun) after you change the keyboard layout, furthermore, it has no currently reliable way to start it on login or after boot.

So, let's get started, if you don't have one:

```
sudo apt install dconf-editor
```

Open it up, and see the `org.gnome.desktop.input-sources.xkb-options`, you might see `[]` for now, but update it to `['ctrl:swap_lalt_lctl','ctrl:swap_ralt_rctl']`.

You should see the effect immediately.

Furthermore, you might have problem with `alt+tab` (now currently is `ctrl+tab`), if you want to change to `ctrl+tab`, just to keep it matched with the physical `alt`, read on.

### Change Alt + Tab to Ctrl + Tab

It turns out even you have the `unity-tweak-tool` it's not at all straightforward to change this, because the tool won't allow you to bind `ctrl+tab` actually it won't allow even `alt+tab`, I think it's a bug or the app has no privilege to intercept the `alt+tab` itself.

So, another way is through the `compizconfig-settings-manager`, if you don't have it just install.

In it, you should find the **Ubuntu Unity Plugin** section, go to **Switcher**. 

Now update it to be as follows, see the **Key to start the switcher** is now set to `<Control>Tab`:

If you want to also change the shortcut for switching windows in the same app (which default is **alt + grave accent**), you may change it now with the **Key to flip through windows in the Switcher** set it to **control + grave accent** instead.
