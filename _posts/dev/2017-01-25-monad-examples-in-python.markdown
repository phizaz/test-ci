I have heard this keyword quite a long time ago. I searched for it in google but not really the top links could elucidate it for me.

**Wikipedia** just only makes the matter worse... a bunch of non-sense examples and far-too-general explanations.

After a while, I finally stumbled upon this link (https://www.stephanboyer.com/post/9/monads-part-1-a-design-pattern). 

It explians quite well because it gives extensive examples. Would I have to sum it up I would say monad is an operation may be a function that links kinda-same operations together which originally it cannot. It provides error fixing, in short, it provides the links betwewen operations as it should be.

I would say no more ... the link is just too good to be missed anyone who seeks sensible monad examples like I did.
