The day has come. The day that I cease to use macOS and start to use Windows (again). This day, I am a developer now and Windows is notoriously known for giving bad development environment. 

Not quite anymore there is someone writing a way to migrate me to the Windows system. Here it is: https://github.com/felixrieseberg/windows-development-environment

Basically, use install `chocolatey`, a package manager, and then use this to install the rest including `cmder` which is a replacement for PowerShell or CMD.

I have just started, and many more things are waiting for me....
