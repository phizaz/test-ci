It has been more than a year without an update to the blog. It is because I quitted being a developer, and becoming a machine learning researcher. The blog, which has initially been conceived for jotting down my development struggles, seems unfit for my new direction.

Now I aim to revive the blog somehow with a new goal under new requirements. The contents before were about coding snippets, but now I have to look from an academic perspective. My blog may need to support more for equations. I take this opportunity as a fresh start to try out **Jekyll**, a static-file blog platform. 

Currently, I have migrated contents from the old blog to here.
