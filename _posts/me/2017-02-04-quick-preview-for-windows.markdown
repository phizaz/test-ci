Looking for an macOS' quick view alternative on Windows ? 

**Seer** is here for you. Seer is a great app, I've just installed and used. It's beautiful, minimal, and fast. It's a perfect alternative for macOS' quick view. (see the thread for more informatin)

You can just use `space` that you love in Windows Explorer to trigger **seer**. It's just that easy!
