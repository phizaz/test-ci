title: STEEM and Steemit
---
Here is what I know

## Coins

1. **Steem**
Official currency of the Steem network, it is viewed as a mean to exchange for **Steem Power** or **Steem Dollar** or other cryptocurrencies or real currencies of your choice. If one is talking about trading it is this one. It is not to be held for a long time though. It has good risk for being diluted for it is being created to be twice as much in a year. 
2. **Steem Power**
An illiquid kind of currency, you cannot transfer, cash it back it any way. It can only give you more "status" on the network. It's also a kind of investment in case you want to grow with the network. 90% of the new values generated from the network will be of this type.
3. **Steem Dollar**
This "dollar" has value equal to a real-world dollar, how ? The Steem network will produce only a "small fraction" of the whole network value collectively, so it will always be scarce as it is backed by the real world value of the network itself. 


## Getting a real dollar from Steem dollar

The way is **Steem Dollar** to **Steem** to **Bitcoin** to currency of your choice. 

I reckon that exchanging **Steem Dollar** to **Steem** will be at the exchange rate at which you will likely to get a full US dollar.

Bitcoin, to date, may be the only way by which other cryptocurrencies exchange to the real money.

## Mining

You will only get the **Steem Power**, illiquid type of currency. That means by the mean of mining you will only get more "influence" over the steem network not the "money" itself.
