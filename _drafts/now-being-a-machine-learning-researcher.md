title: Becoming a machine learning researcher
categories: me
---

I have a hope that before my days are over I would like to see machines come to consciousness and there shall be no more "need" for humans to do chores they don't want to do. 

I don't count myself amongst the great minds around the world. I do wish to contribute. 

I now part from being a developer to be a full-time machine learning researcher. In fact, this has been for more than a year. This is my life pursuit now, I don't expect to put a stop to it. 

I am now pursuing a master degree in machine learning at Chulalongkorn University.
