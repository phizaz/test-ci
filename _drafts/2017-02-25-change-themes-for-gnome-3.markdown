I personally use **paper**, it's quite good though.

You can download and install it from https://snwh.org/paper

For ubuntu users:

```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:snwh/pulp
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install paper-icon-theme
sudo apt-get install paper-gtk-theme
sudo apt-get install paper-cursor-theme
```

And re-login to your account, you should see it available in **Tweak Tool**, in case you don't have one just install it from `apt install gnome-tweak-tool`.
