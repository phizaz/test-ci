title: Type git commit message before you code !
---
I have a chance to discuss about the **git flow** and **sigle branch flow**. The main idea I can capture was it is good to have a single commit do only one specific thing (on the one hand, you can type a short enough message, on the other, it is easy to go back in time without much side effects).

Also, to "type commit message before coding" is heavily emphasized by the single branch flow that you have to be specific and be sure before you commit that your code works and it has the specified characteristics.

Altogether, I am realized that I should be more **specific** and also more **objective** about the code I write for each commit. I will sure begin with typing the git message before I start typing my code.
